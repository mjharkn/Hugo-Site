When it comes to collecting information, note-taking is a skill that I have never been formally taught, and assumed it was something you learned through experience. I think that's the case for a lot of students, and while that assumption is partially true, there are teachable strategies for taking notes that help make the process more efficient and effective. 

A strategy I find helpful is to look at note-taking through different lenses. In a chapter on note-taking in his book The Princeton Guide to Historical Research Zachary Schrag presents the idea of reading and annotating sources as mining for relevant content Doing this helps make the process more intentional. Schrag describes the aim of note-taking as to collect “ingots” that answer your research question and support your argument(s). I see this as an important mindset to have while researching for two reasons. The first is that to find these ingots, one has to know what they’re looking for; this results in the research question(s) taking center stage throughout the note-taking process.

One of the ways that I center the audience while taking notes is by asking lots of questions. These sometimes serve me, as they help me stimulate ideas, but they also make me anticipate questions my reader might ask. Let's use this annotation I made while reading Lynn Hunt’s chapter “The Bad Mother” from The Family Romance of the French Revolution as an example:

I make an observation, then ask questions that my reader may ask if I were to include this bit of information in my final project. This note can potentially expand the depth of my topic by keeping my reader in mind and stimulating a discussion in my research early in the process. This helps me to enter into the conversation my argument and its significance, which is arguably the most important aspect of writing history. Kate Turabian discusses this importance in her introductory chapter of A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, by asserting that readers will always ask "So what?" when reading your research.2 If you cannot answer, you run the risk of your work losing meaning.

The second reason is that viewing note-taking as mining increases efficiency—when one knows what they’re looking for, gathering information becomes a little less daunting and time-consuming by skillfully skimming and identifying key points. I differentiate between my notes by highlighting them in different colors. When annotating the same document mentioned above, I use pink to highlight general information that I want to consider, but probably won’t quote or reference directly. These mainly serve to push my research along and get me thinking. To distinguish the information that I’m more likely to cite in my paper, I use yellow. This helps me find the information I need when drafting and going back to my sources for information.

In terms of organizing my notes, I find it helpful to use a software (for me, Zotero) to group and connect my annotated sources. I do this through the use of folders and tags. For example, I keep each of my notes for the courses I’m currently taking in separate folders divided by week. I also store those that I could potentially use in my thesis research in a separate folder where I divide them by type (article, book, excerpt, etc.) and assign tags to them so I know what topics, methods, period, location, etc. This helps me quickly locate my notes and sources whenever I need to go back to them.

When combined, these strategies can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your note-taking. As someone whose research process is typically non-linear, making my notes intentional and organized is essential to students beginning to build their bibliographies and researching and writing for history with increased depth and sophistication.
