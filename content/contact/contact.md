Hello! My name is Mandolyn Harkness. I'm MA student and Teaching Assistant at Clemson University. I was born and raised in Wheeling, West Virginia and earned my bachelors degrees in History and English Writing & Rhetoric from West Liberty University in 2024.

My research area is 17th and 18th century France and women, sex, and gender studies. I'm currently interested in studying women’s roles in the public sphere as authors during intellectual and cultural movements in early modern France. 

My undergraduate research focused on the publications of the salonnières during the Enlightenment, where I highlighted their roles not just as hostesses but as philosophers. I hope to continue my research at Clemson, shifting my focus to study women outside of the salon.
