## Abstract
Salonnières were the women who hosted the salon1 gatherings attended by some of the most prominent Enlightenment philosophes. Although their role as hostesses was integral to the spread of Enlightenment thought, this was not their only contribution to the movement. Because of the prominence placed upon their role as the ‘polite feminine host’, they have often been thought of by scholars as nothing more than that. However, in examining their writings, it becomes clear that these women played a more active role in the spread and development of Enlightenment ideas. As hostesses in their salon space, these women were granted authority which allowed them to pursue their ambitions through various means, with writing being the most common choice. These written works were mostly fictional, but sometimes they were scholarly. The texts of all these salonnières, regardless of genre, exhibit clear Enlightenment themes that were inspired by the philosophes, whom these women entertained daily in their salons.

Therefore, these women who have largely been considered to be a mere guide for the philosophes of the French Enlightenment are revealed to have had a much more active role. This role is highlighted by examining the fictional and scholarly works of the writers and salonnières Françoise de Graffigny, Louise d’Èpinay, Madame Necker, and Sophie de Grouchy. Upon performing a close analysis of these women’s writings, it becomes apparent that they demonstrate Enlightenment thought using textual themes. These Enlightenment themes, as they will be referred to throughout, appear as follows: skepticism in Madame de Graffigny, empirical reasoning in Louise d’Èpinay, natural law in both Madame Necker and Sophie de Grouchy, and modernization in Grouchy.
