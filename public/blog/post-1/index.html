                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Hello! My name is Mandolyn Harkness and I&rsquo;ll be using this site to post blog entries on various historical topics and methods.</p>
<p>I am currently a first year MA student at Clemson University, where I also work as a TA. I am interseted in researching French female authors through their published works, particularly focusing on the 17th and 18th centuries. I am interested in examining how they utilized the form to exert their authority in the growing public sphere and how their works developed major written forms, such as the &ldquo;nouvelle&rdquo; (novel). I am also interested in exploring how the roles of singleness and/or widowhood effected their public and written authority.</p>
<p>Last semester, I took a class on historical methods in the digital age, where I was introduced to digital history and its various concepts and tools. I am interested in how digital methods can be applicable to my own research, particularly text analysis.</p>
<p>I aim to use this blog to write on and document my experiences working with various digital methods and tools in my historical research, documenting the good and the bad. I hope my experiences can help others as well!</p>
