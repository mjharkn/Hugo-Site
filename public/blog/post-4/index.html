                <h3 id="historical-fact"><strong>Historical &ldquo;Fact&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>To observe how a historical fact is used across different sources, we’ll be looking at three articles whose topics deal primarily or partially in the Parisian salon during the Enlightenment. The fact being compared is that salons were a place of conversation/discussion. The articles we’ll be looking at are: “Enlightenment Salons: The Convergence of Female and Philosophic Ambitions” by Dena Goodman, “The Kingdom of Politesse: Salons and the Republic of Letters in Eighteenth-Century Paris” by Antoine Lilti, and “The French Enlightenment Network” by Maria Teodora Comsa et al. </p>
<p>The fact is stated as “conversation has always been the primary activity of salons” and “conversation shaped the discursive space within the salon” (340). </p>
<h2 id="enlightenment-salons-the-convergence-of-female-and-philosophic-ambitions-by-dena-goodman"><strong>&ldquo;Enlightenment Salons: The Convergence of Female and Philosophic Ambitions&rdquo; by Dena Goodman</strong></h2>
<p>In this article, Goodman is arguing that the salon was a space for women’s intellectual development and ambitions. She uses this fact to support this thesis by arguing that conversations between salonnieres (either with philosophes, political figures, or fellow salonnieres) carried out within the salon would continue in correspondence. She says that this letter writing spurred by the salon space allowed women to develop their philosophic thoughts and gain more intellectual independence and influence.</p>
<p>For primary sources, Goodman cites Larrouse, which is, from what I could find, a French encyclopedia/dictionary (330). However, later Mme. Necker’s journal entry where she describes the importance of preparing for conversations before every gathering is used as a primary source (335).</p>
<h2 id="the-kingdom-of-politesse--salons-and-the-republic-of-latters-in-eighteenth-century-paris-by-antoine-lilti"><strong>&ldquo;The Kingdom of Politesse:  Salons and the Republic of Latters in Eighteenth-Century Paris&rdquo; by Antoine Lilti</strong></h2>
<p>The fact here in this article is stated more subtly, as Lilti discusses the importance of conversation throughout, establishing that it is a fact that it was an important activity. The closest he gets is “In the salons, social hierarchies were conspicuous and the art of conversation was also the art of praise” (5). I believe this statement makes it clear that conversation was an important aspect of the salon.</p>
<p>Lilti uses conversation, however, in a different way than Goodman. Lilti argues that conversation was less of an intellectual exchange and more of a “social parade” (5). He states that polite conversation was the primary form, and that it was an entirely different exchange than scholarly conversation (4). To cite the importance of conversation (specifically the polite variant which Lilti is arguing for) he references Diderot and Marmontel’s descriptions on the impressiveness of Ferdinando Galiani’s conversation and them being impressed by his skills, humor, and stories. </p>
<h2 id="the-french-enlightenment-network-by-maria-teodora-comsa-et-al"><strong>&ldquo;The French Enlightenment Network&rdquo; by Maria Teodora Comsa et al.</strong> </h2>
<p>This article is a bit unique, as it deals in creating metadata to map what they dub the “French Enlightenment Network.” The fact of sociability being integral is stated as, “That said, the salons played such a legendary role in the social networks of the Enlightenment that we decided to include the most well-documented instances of salon attendance in our metadata” (524).</p>
<p>The context is a bit more integrated into this fact, making it seem more like a claim, but is still incorporating the pre-assumed notion that salons were important places of conversation. As is also seen in this quote, the authors are arguing for the salons to be included in their network, which is based on sociability between Enlightenment thinkers throughout western Europe. To back up this claim, they use their own data and state “In our dataset, documented attendance at one of the major French salons was highly correlated with active participation in the French Enlightenment network” and then give figures to back this up (5).</p>
<h3 id="historical-fallacy"><strong>Historical Fallacy</strong></h3>
<p>To examine a historical fallacy, we&rsquo;ll be looking at Christopher Allmand&rsquo;s book, The Hundred Years War. In this book, I would argue that this work commits the one of the fallacies of narration, the static fallacy. In David Hackett&rsquo;s book, Historian&rsquo;s Fallacies, he describes it as, &ldquo;any attempt to conceptualize a dynamic problem in static terms&rdquo; (153). I would argue that Allmand does so by arguing that The Hundred Years War resulted in the growth of a strong national identity in England and France. Although Allmand proves this to be true among the upper class, nobility, and some combatants, he ignores the peasantry and their overall dissatisfaction with their nation.</p>
<p>His main mentions of the non-combatants are in how they contributed to war via taxation in both England and France. Because of this, his logic makes sense in concluding that this war was a matter of the state, since every member of the state was having to contribute to the warring effort in some form. However, Allmand’s statement that this acceptance from society that war was for the common good, is too general of an assumption. Although he does mention that civilians were upset about having to pay taxes, he glosses over the issue too smoothly. It is understandable that not every detail of the Hundred Years’ War and its consequences can be covered in such a short book, but this is a core part of Allmand’s argument that he does not justify enough. Especially considering that he makes the argument that a national conscience was being formed, especially in France, based partly on political unity.</p>
<p>While Allmand does provide evidence that both the rich and the poor were subject to nationalistic propoganda, he fails to consider that this national conscience was shared by all members of society. He mentions events taking place in France that represent national unity, but these seem to be events that were likely attended by the upper class.</p>
<p>The largest disservice Allmand does to his argument is that he fails to consider that this ‘national conscience’ mostly existed among the upper class/nobility, and was not as common in the lower classes/peasantry. Considering the many peasant rebellions that occurred during the Hundred Years’ War, such as the one occurring in 1381 in England and Jacquerie in France, it could be argued that there was more social divide that these countries were facing as a result of the war, rather than unity. A peasant rebellion seems to be a rejection of the central authority that Allmand claims was what the people were looking towards while developing this nationalistic conscience. This is where the logic of Allmand’s argument falls flat, and although it is only the case for one aspect of his argument, it still weakens his thesis overall, and demonstrates its static nature.</p>
<p>Allmand&rsquo;s work was expansive, and by no means does this fallacy render his work useless. This book offers a great and fairly detailed survey of The Hundred Years War. Its nature in being a survey, however, results in a looser argument overall with less direct support and specific evidence that is needed to back up its big claims.</p>
