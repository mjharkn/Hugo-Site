<p>To observe how a historical fact is used across different sources, we’ll be looking at three articles whose topics deal primarily or partially in the Parisian salon during the Enlightenment. The fact being compared is that salons were a place of conversation/discussion. The articles we’ll be looking at are: “Enlightenment Salons: The Convergence of Female and Philosophic Ambitions” by Dena Goodman, “The Kingdom of Politesse: Salons and the Republic of Letters in Eighteenth-Century Paris” by Antoine Lilti, and “The French Enlightenment Network” by Maria Teodora Comsa et al. </p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/post-4/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p><p>As AI has become more increasingly prevalent in recent years, we have begun to see its tools being incorporated into the humanities. JSTOR, an online database of academic journals, books, and more has recently integrated an AI tool. At its most basic level, this tool aims to offer a detailed summary of the text you&rsquo;re looking at. The tool also can perform more complex tasks, such as recommending topics, showing related content, and having the ability to answer questions you have about the text. Today, I&rsquo;ll be discussing my experience using the JSTOR AI model to determine its accuracy and general helpfulness in discussing an article in French Historical Studies, titled &ldquo;Seeking Separations: Gender, Marriages, and Household Economies in Early Modern France&rdquo; by Julie Hardwick.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/post-3/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p><p>When it comes to collecting information, note-taking is a skill that I have never been formally taught, and assumed it was something you learned through experience. I think that&rsquo;s the case for a lot of students, and while that assumption is partially true, there are teachable strategies for taking notes that help make the process more efficient and effective. </p>
<p>A strategy I find helpful is to look at note-taking through different lenses. In a chapter on note-taking in his book The Princeton Guide to Historical Research Zachary Schrag presents the idea of reading and annotating sources as mining for relevant content Doing this helps make the process more intentional. Schrag describes the aim of note-taking as to collect “ingots” that answer your research question and support your argument(s). I see this as an important mindset to have while researching for two reasons. The first is that to find these ingots, one has to know what they’re looking for; this results in the research question(s) taking center stage throughout the note-taking process.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/post-2/">Read more...</a></span>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Salonnières were the women who hosted the salon1 gatherings attended by some of the most prominent Enlightenment philosophes. Although their role as hostesses was integral to the spread of Enlightenment thought, this was not their only contribution to the movement. Because of the prominence placed upon their role as the ‘polite feminine host’, they have often been thought of by scholars as nothing more than that. However, in examining their writings, it becomes clear that these women played a more active role in the spread and development of Enlightenment ideas. As hostesses in their salon space, these women were granted authority which allowed them to pursue their ambitions through various means, with writing being the most common choice. These written works were mostly fictional, but sometimes they were scholarly. The texts of all these salonnières, regardless of genre, exhibit clear Enlightenment themes that were inspired by the philosophes, whom these women entertained daily in their salons.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/research/undergrad-research/">Read more...</a></span>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper explores how Madeleine de Scudéry redefined the French heroic romance through her concept of amitié tendre, or “loving friendship,” as articulated in The <em>Story of Sapho</em>, a volume from her monumental novel <em>Artamène ou le Grand Cyrus</em>.</p>
<p>In a genre historically dominated by male authors and valorized masculine heroism through warfare and conquest, Scudéry reorients the narrative toward female agency, emotional intelligence, and egalitarian love. By replacing action with dialogue, reimagining exotic settings as safe spaces for alternative romantic paradigms, and recasting heroism as gallant obedience to feminine authority, Scudéry subverts the traditional tropes of the heroic romance.</p><span> <a href="http://localhost:1313/research/scudery-research/">Read more...</a></span>
